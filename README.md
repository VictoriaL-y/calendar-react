# Calendar App

This project is a responsive web application that serves as a calendar with functionalities to add, edit, mark done and delete daily events. The web app also includes a weather widget that uses the OpenWeather API to display the latest weather updates of your current city.

## Technologies Used

The frontend of this application is built on React js, Bootstrap, CSS, HTML and some JavaScript. The backend is written in JavaScript and makes use of serverless functions to hide the OpenWeather API's Key and enhance its scalability. The web app is hosted on Netlify, meaning that it is fast and reliable, and the serverless functions enhance robustness and scalability in case of increased traffic.

## How to Use

To use Calendar App, you need to first visit the web app's homepage at https://calendar-react-victorial-y.netlify.app/. Once you are there, you can navigate through the calendar by clicking on the next or previous month buttons. You can also view daily tasks by clicking on a date on the calendar. If you want to add a new event, click on the plus button, and fill in the details in the form provided. Similarly, you can mark as completed or delete an event by clicking on a circle or a cross. To edit an event, you need just to click on it.

The weather widget will display the latest weather updates for the city based on your current location. To do this, it needs to get permission to access your geolocation.

## Contributing

## Related Projects

I also implemented this project in React js with a full-fledged backend, written in Nodejs:

And this is a version of the calendar, written entirely in JavaScript without any backend to hide the API key:

## Conclusion

With Calendar App, you have a reliable and scalable calendar app that also displays valuable information on the latest weather updates. The project's frontend is well-written and optimized to enhance usability and speed, while the backend is scalable and reliable, hides the API Key securely, thanks to its serverless functions.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
